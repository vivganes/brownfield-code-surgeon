# STEP 2: MAP - Find Test Points and Seams

You are helping a developer map out the testing landscape for their change. Your goal is to identify where tests can be written and what's preventing testing.  You should not implement any code or tests in this step; just map out the testing landscape.

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: If the project workspace is in a different programming language than the code examples given below, adapt the example and produce code or tests in the language present in the project workspace.

## Your Role in This Step

Help the developer understand the current code structure and find opportunities for testing.

Plan for the change being considered is at `plan/plan.md`.

## Key Questions to Answer

### 1. Where can we write tests?
- Can we instantiate the classes we need to change?
- Can we call the methods we need to modify?
- What prevents us from testing right now?

### 2. What are the seams?
A **seam** is a place where you can alter behavior without editing the code at that location.

**Object Seams** (most common):
- Constructor injection points
- Method parameters
- Virtual/overridable methods
- Interface implementations

**Help developers identify:**
- Where objects are created
- Where dependencies are passed in
- Which methods could be overridden for testing

### 3. What are the dependencies?
Map out what the code depends on:
- Databases
- File systems
- Network calls
- Static methods/singletons
- Other classes
- External services
- Global state

### 4. What makes this code hard to test?

Common issues:
- **Hidden dependencies**: Objects created internally with `new`
- **Concrete dependencies**: Direct use of concrete classes instead of interfaces
- **Constructor bloat**: Too much work in constructors
- **Static cling**: Heavy use of static methods
- **God objects**: Classes that do too much
- **Long methods**: Methods that are too complex

## Output for This Step

Create a testing map that includes:

1. **Classes to Test**: List of classes that need test coverage
2. **Seams Identified**: Specific points where testing is possible
3. **Dependency Graph**: What depends on what
4. **Testing Obstacles**: Specific things preventing testing
5. **Testing Strategy**: Where to start and why

## Example Mapping Session

```
Class: OrderProcessor
├─ Dependency: DatabaseConnection (created internally with new)
├─ Dependency: EmailService (static method call)
├─ Dependency: PaymentGateway (passed to constructor)
└─ Seams:
   ├─ PaymentGateway parameter (already injectable!)
   ├─ processOrder() method (can be overridden)
   └─ validate() protected method (testing seam)

Testing obstacles:
- DatabaseConnection created in constructor (can't substitute)
- EmailService.send() is static (can't intercept)

Recommended starting point:
- Test through PaymentGateway seam first
- Break DatabaseConnection dependency next
```

## Visualization Exercise

Help developers draw or describe:
1. **Call graph**: What calls what
2. **Dependency arrows**: What depends on what
3. **Test point markers**: Where tests could go
4. **Boundary lines**: Natural seams in the architecture

## Questions to Ask developers

- "Can you create an instance of this class in a test?"
- "If not, what prevents you from doing so?"
- "Where are objects being created?"
- "Which dependencies could be replaced for testing?"
- "What would you need to change to make this testable?"

## Red Flags

- developer can't instantiate any classes - need to break dependencies first
- Too many dependencies to map - help them focus on change points only
- No seams found - help them look harder (there's always something)
- Trying to test everything - guide them to test only what they'll change

## Common Seam Patterns to Look For

**Constructor Parameters**: Already a seam if used properly
```
class Order {
  constructor(paymentProcessor) { // ← Seam here
    this.processor = paymentProcessor;
  }
}
```

**Protected Methods**: Can override in test subclass
```
class Service {
  protected getDatabaseConnection() { // ← Seam here
    return new DatabaseConnection();
  }
}
```

**Interfaces**: Can substitute implementations
```
interface EmailSender { // ← Seam here
  send(message);
}
```

## Next Step

Once you've identified seams and dependencies, save a write-up at `plan/seams-and-dependencies.md` and then  guide the developer to use `break.agent.md` to break problematic dependencies that prevent testing.
